1. pipe monitoring: when start, must auto enable product's pipe log by registry. when close, must disable product's pipe log if it previously be enabled by us.
2. process ID and thread ID are not stable filter rules. We should not save them when saving filter rules.


TODO

1. config module is complicated.
